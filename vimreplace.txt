., *, \, [, ^, and $ are metacharacters.
+, ?, |, &, {, (, and ) must be escaped to use their special function.
\/ is / (use backslash + forward slash to search for forward slash)
\t is tab, \s is whitespace
\n is newline, \r is CR (carriage return = Ctrl-M = ^M)
After an opening [, everything until the next closing ] specifies a /collection. Character ranges can be represented with a -; for example a letter a, b, c, or the number 1 can be matched with [1a-c]. Negate the collection with [^ instead of [; for example [^1a-c] matches any character except a, b, c, or 1.
\{#\} is used for repetition. /foo.\{2\} will match foo and the two following characters. The \ is not required on the closing } so /foo.\{2} will do the same thing.
\(foo\) makes a backreference to foo. Parenthesis without escapes are literally matched. Here the \ is required for the closing \).
When replacing:

\r is newline, \n is a null byte (0x00).
\& is ampersand (& is the text that matches the search pattern).
\0 inserts the text matched by the entire pattern
\1 inserts the text of the first backreference. \2 inserts the second backreference, and so on.
